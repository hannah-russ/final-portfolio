           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Starting this course, I did not know anything about coding, which I quickly learned is okay because I have other assets that can help me excel in this class. I am an Architecture majorso I know how to design for a soecific audience and I think that is very important considering the final project. I have used my creative mind to outside of the box with my last couple projects and have been very proud of the work that I have done. I felt as though the first project was just to get to know the software, but I started feeling more creative in the last two projects. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">It is very intimidating coming into a classroom of different majors, but I figured out that through these differnt lenses, in can bring a new sense of creativity. Working out problems with people before class starts has really helped me connect with people I would have not have connected with before. My classmates have been able to help me with my HTML problems, but have also inspired me to try new, crazy, weird things that I would not have thought about before.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Craft is somthing that is a very big deal within my major and I find it very important when showcasing and the design process. Without craft, it may be hard to understand an idea or get the intended idea across. Through this class and the projects within, I have found how to try new things with the thought of craft in mind. Craft in this case is making sure everything is set the way that is easiest to understand, but still reaching your main goal/presentation. </p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Like I said I knew nothing about coding at all before this class, I would even say it intimidated me a lot. The projects have changed my perspective on being confident about it. Through the internet and through our readings, I have researched on how coding works and the ins and outs of it. I have also developed this "hacker" skill that I did not know that I could do before.</p>

I have hacked through the HTML to present my work through this portfolio. I now know how to get the effects I want, but still have a lot left to learn!</p>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Through these last six projects I have found myself to feel more creative when making them. Without having to learn a whole language or program, I found it easier to be more creative with things I am more familiar with. Previously, I have taken photography classes, so I was very comfotable with the photo essay assignment. Through the photo essay assignment I realized I was taking pictures for another class, but these are what I took pictures of for a completely different assignment. I realized these were raw photos that all show the journey of this neighborhood and they all revolve around pollution.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I feel as though through the beginning of class workshops and the end of class workshops I have interacted with other classmates that do not sit around me that have helped me a lot. I have realized that I have a similar project to one other classmate and completely different projects to everyone else. Everone elses projects have given me inspiration for mine.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">When thinking about craft and how these projects have changed or insired that I think that they have all helped me for my final project. I have learned how to add pictures and videos into one video with sound. I have learned how to animate and make characters my own. With all of this information I will be able to craft my final project for the class.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">This section of the class has definitely prepared me for the final project through intense research. Four weeks of research, looking at three sources each week have taught me how to research and realize what is important to the topic. I have learned through these past six projects the skills of premiere pro, after effects in premiere pro, and adobe character creation.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">These projects have given me the tools needed for me to present my final works for the class. Like I have said previously I have just now learned these programs and they are going to help my final project work tremendously. I am going to present my final through adobe character creator and through premiere pro put my videos together. I will aso be using vs code and HTML to form my final presentation.</p>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I learned how to be more creative in a non-physical way through HTML and through adobe character creator. I learned how to make my own character, how to sync up a prerecorded audio to the video,and how to add this all into HTML. Before this class being creative online did not seem very possible for me because I am a hands on learner. I quicly realized that is not that hard to be creative in a digital way, you may just have to find your way around the issues you encounter.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Through the presentation and the final project I have definietely learned how to go about askign different questions and helping one another out. Recently I had gotten an extension for the final project and I realized that after everyone had presented their projects, I could do what they were doing. I saw what they did and asked them how they did that. I learned from them and used that within my own project, such examples are learning how to add in autoplay and making an AI voice from a script.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have thought deeply about what I want out of this project and what I want it to look like. I realized that the craft and order was very important to me and so I created very detailed storyboards that had exactly what I wanted to portray through this final project. You could even say that I thought so deeply about the craft and what I wanted out of this project that I had to create a script and a character to make this project work.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Through this last third of the semester we have taken a deep dive into research and skills development. I learned the correct and efficient way to research, not only through the internet, but through youtube. Youtube became a vital resource for me and my research to find new things that people were experimenting with to help produce environementally friendly products.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Having to do these portfolios has shown me the best way to present my work and how to make it look clean. I want to recognize that also through my final project I learned how I wanted to present my work in a orderly fashion that makes sense. I will be taking all of this knowledge and using it to my advantage in future projects.</p>
